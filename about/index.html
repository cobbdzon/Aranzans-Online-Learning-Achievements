                Nuestra Se√±ora de Aranzazu Parochial School is a Catholic school that offers a lot of things to the students also to the guardians even if it's Online Learning.<br>
                In our school, we have here a beautiful church. It's the main church in our place. This church was build for so many years.<br>
                One of the aims in our school is to deepen the understanding when it comes to faith, usually talks about on how to be a true follower of Jesus Christ.<br>
                The employees here are very kind.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's our saying in our school,
                <br>I am an Aranzan, I C.A.R.E.
                <br>It means that each one of the Aranzans are very caring and offers a lot of opportunities to the student to gain their confidence.
                <br>We are very proud to share it to everyone because as part of an Aranzan community,
                <br>it really helps us when it comes to studying especially in strengthening our faith.
